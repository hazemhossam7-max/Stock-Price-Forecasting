## 📈 Stock Price Forecasting

This project predicts future stock prices using time-series analysis and deep learning models. It demonstrates forecasting techniques for financial data.

### 📂 Dataset
- Historical stock market prices (date, open, close, high, low, volume).

### 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalization of price data.
   - Time-series train/test split.
2. **Model Training**:
   - ARIMA and Prophet for statistical forecasting.
   - LSTM and GRU networks for deep learning forecasting.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - RMSE, MAE, and visualization of actual vs. predicted prices.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook to train and evaluate models
